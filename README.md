## XingPad

---

An iPad XING client using the XING API v1.

### Project Setup

Clone the project including submodules:

	$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/robertoseidenberg/Xingpad.git
	$ cd Xingpad
	
Build and run the project using XCode.

### Debugging

Install [PonyDebugger](https://github.com/square/PonyDebugger) and run it using the terminal:

	ponyd serve --listen-interface=127.0.0.1
	
	
###Coding guidelines
Some macros are being defined in XINGPad-Prefix.pch. Use these for debugging reasons. [Read more ...](http://www.cimgf.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=http://www.cimgf.com/2010/05/02/my-current-prefix-pch-file/)

#####DLog

Never use NSLog. Use DLog instead. DLog output is beeing silenced in release builds.

	DLog(@"Some va: r%@", <#(id)#>);

#####ALog

If you need logging in release builds use ALog. It throws an assertion when being hit in DEBUG mode and converts to an NSLog in release builds.

	// Error
	NSAssert(<#(evaluation to NO throws assertion)#>, @"It failed");

###### ZASSert

Use these assertions macros to validate objects at runtime.

	// Violation
	// It's not allowed to call this method with a nil argument
	ZAssert(<#(evaluation to NO throws assertion)#>, @"VIOLATION: Method argument <#(id)#><#(name)#>: %@", <#(id)#>);
	
	// Inconsistency
	ZAssert(<#(Evaluation passes if YES)#>, @"INCONSISTENCY: <#(id)#> object not found in <#(id)#>!");

### Documentation

Documentation for the project is being generated using [appledoc](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc). The doc can be generated by building the Documentation target. The generated files will be stored in the XCode docs path and can be read in the organizer.
